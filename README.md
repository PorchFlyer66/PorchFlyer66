- 👋 Hi, I’m @PorchFlyer66, Retired with another new hobby.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning all aspects of repairing, building and flying quad's
- 🌱 I’m currently learning different protocols, different electronic parts and abbreviated language of the hobby
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any and everything
- 📫 How to reach me,, Come to north Florida
My biggest trouble with all of this is downloading with slow internet, reflashing this for that,, 
Pretty much the computer part of this hobby is sometimes hard for me to wrap my head around, the soldering, putting togeather and building is a piece of cake..
